The Twitter Plant
==================

A simple Arduino Yun project that waters a plant based on tweets offering water to the plant by kind strangers.

This project uses the Arduino Yun to connect to the Internet and control a pump that waters the plant. The Yun uses Temboo Choreos to ease communication with the twitter API.

You will need Twitter API keys for access to Twitter resources, and a Temboo API key to connect to Temboo.
